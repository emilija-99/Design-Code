debounce - utility function used to control the frequency of function execution 
(dealing with events like scrolling, resizing, or input..)

window.scrollY - property returns the number of pixels the document has been scrolled vertically. 
It represents how far the user has scrolled down the page from the top. 
window.innerHeight - returns the height of the viewport in pixels

window.scrollY + window.innerHeight - expression callculates the current vertical position of the viewpoet's scroll 
plus height of the viewport itself. - determine the position of the bottom edge of the viewport relative to the 
entire documnet.

sliderImages - calculate the vertical position of the bottom edge of an element.

const slideInAt = (window.scrollY + window.innerHeight) - sliderImages.height / 2; - 
calculate a position that's roughly halfway up the sliderImages element's height from the bottom of the viewport.

.offsetTop - return the distance in pixels from the top of the closest relatively positioned ancestor element.
gives you a vertical distance from the top of sliderImages to the top of its containing element.

.height - it returns the height of the element in pixels.

const imageBottom = sliderImages.offsetTop + sliderImages.height;
.offTop get the vertical distance from the top to .height of the element - you get the vertical position of
the bottom egde of the sliderImages element relative to the top of its containing element.
Calculates the vertical position of the bottom egde of the sliderImages element within its conaining element

isHalfShown - condition will be true if the sliderImage is at least partially visiable in the viewport - halfway up

isNotScrolledPast - if the current vertical scroll position is lees then the vertical position of the bottom egde
of the element.
Condition will be true if the user has not scrolled past element.
